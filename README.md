## ✨ Key Features

### 📊 Real-Time Health Monitoring
- **Live Vitals:** Visualizes sensor data such as **Heart Rate (BPM)**, **Body Temperature**, and **Oxygen Saturation (SpO2)**.
- **Dynamic Charts:** Uses interactive graphs to show trends over time (Hourly/Daily).
- **Device Status:** Monitors battery life and connectivity of connected IoT devices.

### 🔐 Security & Privacy
- **Secure Authentication:** Role-based login for Doctors, Patients, and Admins.
- **Data Integrity:** Ensures patient data is displayed accurately without unauthorized manipulation.
- **Access Control:** Restricted views ensuring doctors only see their assigned patients.

### 🚨 Alert System
- **Critical Thresholds:** Automatically triggers visual alerts if vitals go beyond safe limits (e.g., Temperature > 102°F or BPM > 120).
- **Emergency Notifications:** UI indicators for immediate attention.

### 📱 Responsive Dashboard
- **Cross-Platform:** Optimized for Desktops, Tablets, and Mobile devices for on-the-go monitoring.
- **User-Friendly Interface:** Clean, medical-grade UI design with Dark/Light mode support.
